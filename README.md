1. Different ways are there to call a function in R

      a. call(name, ...)  
      where,  name:  is a a non-empty character string naming the function to be called â€¦ stands for arguments to be part of the call 
      call returns an unevaluated function call, that is, an unevaluated expression which consists of the named function applied to the given. Although the call is unevaluated, the arguments ... are evaluated.

      b. do.call   do.call constructs and executes a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to it. 

      c. Recall   Recall is used as a placeholder for the name of the function in which it is called. It allows the definition of recursive functions which still work after being renamed  
 
2. The lazy evaluation of a function means, the argument is evaluated only if it is evaluated only if it is used inside the body of the function.- TRUE 
 
3.  
      a. Insights driven from descriptive analytics is not meaningful.- FALSE 
      
      b. The number of values in each Elements of a list, should be equal.- FALSE 
      
      c. The datasets are not stored in memory of the computer using R.-TRUE
